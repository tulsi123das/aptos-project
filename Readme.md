# ToolRental Smart Contract

## Vision

The **ToolRental** smart contract supports a decentralized sharing economy by allowing users to list tools for rent and enabling others to rent them by paying a rental fee. This platform promotes efficient resource sharing, allowing users to access tools when needed without the burden of ownership.

## Features

- **List Tool for Rent**:
  - Owners can list tools for rent by specifying a rental fee, making the tool available to the community.
- **Rent Tool**:
  - Users can rent tools by paying the rental fee, with the contract ensuring that the tool is available and transferring the payment to the owner.

## Future Scope

1. **Automated Tool Availability**:

   - Implement automatic status updates for tool availability once the rental period ends.

2. **Rental Period Management**:

   - Add features to manage rental periods and extend or terminate rentals based on time or usage.

3. **Review and Rating System**:
   - Introduce a rating system for both tool owners and renters to ensure accountability and trust in the platform.

The **ToolRental** contract promotes resource efficiency and access by enabling decentralized tool sharing, reducing the cost of ownership, and creating opportunities for users to monetize unused tools.
